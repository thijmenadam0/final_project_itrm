# Final Project Introduction to Research Methods

The code for a research for the class 'Introduction to Research Methods' 


## Month Randomizer
This code includes a month randomizer, with the month randomizer you can avoid cherry-picking data by using random months for the experiment. The months I used are April, June, August and September of 2021. We chose the year 2021 so the data is new in comparison to, for example, 2016. We only chose four months seeming that it takes a long time to process one month, using all twelve months was too much for the given amount of time. Randomizing these months gives us fair and usable data.  

You can run the month randomizer by using the following code:  

```$python3 random_months.py```  

Here is the output of the randomized months when we first ran it:
