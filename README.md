# Final Project Introduction to Research Methods

The code for a research for the class 'Introduction to Research Methods' 


## Month Randomizer
This code includes a month randomizer, with the month randomizer you can avoid cherry-picking data by using random months for the experiment. The months I used are April, June, August and September of 2021. I chose the year 2021 so the data is new in comparison to, for example, 2016. I only chose four months seeming that it takes a long time to process one month, using all twelve months was too much for the given amount of time. Randomizing these months gives us fair data.
